# EMR Research
## Apache Spark ![spark](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8f41f79-3338-43ef-b7c2-f93cb602a601)

### contains in memory processing for fast computation, supports multiple languages for versatile workloads like batch and streaming data. good for real time analytics, ML, and interactive queries
## Apache Hadoop ![hadoop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bc67619-26e9-4301-9967-e9a4a2497822)
 
### very good for scalable processing with mapreduce and supports large datasets. good for large scale batch processing, data warehousing, archival and storage
## Apache Pig ![pig](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3583206c-9d8a-42b8-a5cf-8b3bbe44e67b)
### high level scripting for processing large datasets and is easy to write complex transformations. Used in data transformations and ETL processes and batch processing on Hadoop
## Apache Hue ![hue](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf641ecb-f972-4313-be24-2860c084bfff)

### web based interface for Hadoop, easy to use for non technical people. it is a UI tool and not an engine. it is good for for simplified hadoop management and data exploration
## Apache tez ![tez](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b02f83f8-41c0-4ee1-907e-4d0c365ca1bb)

### improves performance over MapReduce and integrates with Hadoop. used for query processing, large scale data processing with more effeciency than MapReduce
## Apache Hive ![hive](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4de35dba-7d81-4545-b81a-35ced8e46593)

### SQL like querying on Hadoop, supports complex queries and data analysis. used for data warehousing, batch processing, and data analysis
## Apache Zepplin ![zeppelin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31f4ed93-2c05-4254-850b-3053d5ebe045)

### web based notebook for interactive data analysis, and supports multiple EMR's like spark, flink, or hadoop. used for data exploration, interactive analysis, and data visualization
## Apache Trino ![trino](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/089e3c8c-d79e-4032-8b0e-21711f33b46d)

### distributed SQL query engine, supports querying data from multiple sources. used for interactive querying, queries across different data sources, real time analytics
## Apache Pheonix ![pheonix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cead67f-f751-41d4-881c-7e106be0160e)

### SQL layer over HBase, has tight integration with Hadoop ecosystem. used for real time analytics on top of HBase, data warehousing with SQL querying capabilities
